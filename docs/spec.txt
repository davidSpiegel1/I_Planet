# I Planet Spec:

## New Design:
	
	-- New architecture --
		
		* We have one GUI file for program. (main)
		* It's job is:
			1.) Take parsed map (2D list) 
			2.) Internal game logic (nested) (Might be in controller)
			3.) Menu/Option dashboard
		# We also have another GUI file for parsing map
			1.) Each *object* in I Planet will have a node associated with it (Derived from .txt)
			2.) While doing this, we allow for character design and artistic elements


	-- New character design --

		* Somehow find a chatGTP API and connect to it
		* Then, each character will change it's response to the user using API call to AI system
		* Also, we want characters to move without the user character moving
			* We could do this using animations and manipulating the specific element within the 
			  2D list object. 
		* Maybe we could have server-based multiplayer

	-- Issues --
		* Currently, deleting inventory is not working.
			* Possible fix: Use 'e' to derive the correct Node to delete 			from GridPane
